*Thivanka, June02 2020*

##Introduction
This assignment delves into error handling and pickling of data. Error handling involves the use of try-exception blocks to catch errors that the user might run into as they proceed through the program. Data pickling involves the creation of a binary file to add and read data from it. These two concepts were tested using simple programs in this module.
